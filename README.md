# Plant-Disease-Detection
This project is an AI-powered system for identifying plant diseases from leaf images using multiple deep learning models. Instead of relying on a single model, it compares predictions from different architectures, evaluates their performance, and selects the most reliable result. This ensures better accuracy, robustness
